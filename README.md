# cafee
The main objective of our Python project is to provide a billing system by
which customers can select a food item from the assorted menu and
proceed to payment. The program creates an “easy-to-use” interface
between customers and café owners. Our Program is such that the
management of recording user details, menu driven changes and billing is
much easier along with a point system.

The program proceeds in a sequence designed to ensure consistency,
reliability and correctness of information shown to the user.
